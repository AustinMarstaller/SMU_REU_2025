Lecture notes and code will be provided on this website. However, be sure to take your own notes as well. 
:::

Every week day will be split into a morning (9AM - 12PM) and afternoon (1:30PM - 5:00PM) session. The first three weeks will have lectures during the morning and afternoon sessions with a 1 hour coding session from 4PM to 5PM. 

Breakfast, lunch, and dinner are provided by the REU through a summer meal card.
