# Welcome


Welcome to the $2025$ Summer REU hosted by the [Computational & Applied Mathematics department](https://www.smu.edu/dedman/academics/departments/math/research) at Southern Methodist University. This REU is supported by the NSF/RTG award # 1840260: ‚ÄúRTG: Modeling and Computations for Complex Systems at Southern Methodist University‚Äù (PI: dr. Alejandro Aceves) and NSF Award #2512931: ‚ÄùEAGER: NAIRR Pilot Expansion: FA1: Swarm Coordination and Autonomous Learning for Emerging Researchers (SCALE)‚Äù (PI: Dr. Joseph Camp).

:::{danger} Summer weather

Be prepared for the Texas summer. Bring sunscreen, linen clothing, cowboy hats, etc.
:::

The goal of this REU is to provide you with a research focused experience for modeling complex phenomena related to drone swarming. During the SMU math department hosted portion of the REU, each student will attend lectures and participate in coding activities. There are $5$ weeks for this part of the REU. After week $4$, students will work in small groups to define and then present a project at the end of the REU. 

All participants will work closely with the TAs. Prior knowledge of the material or coding experience is not required. Curiosity, however, is mandatory.
