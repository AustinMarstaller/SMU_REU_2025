# Welcome


Welcome to the $2025$ Summer REU hosted by the [Computational & Applied Mathematics department](https://www.smu.edu/dedman/academics/departments/math/research) at Southern Methodist University. The Principle Investigators of the REU are Dr. Alejandro Aceves and Dr. Joe Camp. There are four graduate teaching assistants: Daniel Margolis, Showe Liou, Mason McCullum, and Austin Marstaller. 

:::{danger} Summer weather

Be prepared for the Texas summer. Bring sunscreen, linen clothing, cowboy hats, etc.
:::

The goal of this REU is to provide you with a research focused experience for modeling complex phenomena related to drone swarming. During the SMU math department hosted portion of the REU, each student will attend lectures and participate in coding activities. There are $5$ weeks for this part of the REU. After week $4$, students will work in small groups to define and then present a project at the end of the REU. 

All participants will work closely with the TAs. Prior knowledge of the material or coding experience is not required. Curiosity, however, is mandatory.
