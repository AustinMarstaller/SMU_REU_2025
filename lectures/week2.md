# Week 2

Explore the following numerically:

```{exercise} 

Consider the forced harmonic oscillator $$\frac{d^{2}X}{dt^{2}} + \Omega^{2}X = C\sin(\omega t),$$ where $C,\omega$ are constants. Consider three scenarios for these constants: $\Omega << \omega$ (e.g $\omega = 5\Omega$), $\Omega = \omega$, and $\Omega >> \omega$. Use initial conditions of: $X(0)=1$ and $\frac{dX}{dt}(0) = 0$. Explain thoroughly your numerical observations and method. Additionally, for the $\Omega << \omega$ case, explain what happens when the value of $C$ is varied from $C=0$ to $C=3$.

```{exercise} 
Consider $\frac{dX^{2}}{dt^{2}} + \Omega^{2}X = \beta X^{3}$ with initial conditions $X(0)=1$, $\frac{dX}{dt}(0)=0$. Choose a value for the constant $\Omega$. Explore what happens when $\beta = 0.1$ and $\beta = 1$. Explain thoroughly your observations and numerical method.
